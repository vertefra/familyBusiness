export const contractDescription = `The Contract card is the basic card in the game. When you play a Contract on another
player, he must choose one of his mobsters and add him to the Hit List. He places
this mobster at the end of the current line up, or “up against the wall” if there are no
mobsters currently on the Hit List.`

export const priorityContractDescription = `
A Priority Contract works the same as a regular Contract card, except that the targeted
mobster goes “up against the wall”—the mobster is placed first in line next to the
box. Either a Family Influence or a Mob Power counters this card. (If a Mob Power is
played, the Priority Contract player must put one of their own mobsters first in line!).
`

export const doubleContractdescription = `
A Double Contract has the same effect as playing 2 Contract cards on the same
player. The targeted player must put 2 mobsters on the Hit List. Either Family Infl uence
or Mob Power may counter a Double Contract, but the counter card only saves the fi rst
of the two mobsters. In the case of someone playing Mob Power against your Double
Contract, you would place a mobster on the Hit List fi rst, and then your opponent
would place one.
`

export const hitDescription = `
A Hit allows you to immediately eliminate any 1 mobster in play, whether or not that
mobster is on the Hit List. However, you must add 1 of your own mobsters to the
Hit List.
`

export const stValentinedescription = `
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre immediately eliminates all mobsters on the Hit List.
