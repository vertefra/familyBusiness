export const contractDescription = `The Contract card is the basic card in the game. When you play a Contract on another
player, he must choose one of his mobsters and add him to the Hit List. He places
this mobster at the end of the current line up, or “up against the wall” if there are no
mobsters currently on the Hit List.`

export const priorityContractDescription = `
A Priority Contract works the same as a regular Contract card, except that the targeted
mobster goes “up against the wall”—the mobster is placed first in line next to the
box. Either a Family Influence or a Mob Power counters this card. (If a Mob Power is
played, the Priority Contract player must put one of their own mobsters first in line!).
`

export const doubleContractdescription = `
A Double Contract has the same effect as playing 2 Contract cards on the same
player. The targeted player must put 2 mobsters on the Hit List. Either Family Infl uence
or Mob Power may counter a Double Contract, but the counter card only saves the fi rst
of the two mobsters. In the case of someone playing Mob Power against your Double
Contract, you would place a mobster on the Hit List fi rst, and then your opponent
would place one.
`

export const hitDescription = `
A Hit allows you to immediately eliminate any 1 mobster in play, whether or not that
mobster is on the Hit List. However, you must add 1 of your own mobsters to the
Hit List.
`

export const stValentinedescription = `
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre immediately eliminates all mobsters on the Hit List.
`

export const doubleCrossdescription = `
The Double Cross card allows you to collect 1 mobster from each opponent and add
them all to the Hit List in any order that you choose.
`

export const mobWarDescription =`
Mob War starts (or restarts at a normal rate) a Mob War, even if there are less than
6 mobsters on the Hit List.
`

export const ambushDescription = `
An Ambush starts a Mob War, with 2 mobsters killed at the beginning of each player’s
turn. This continues until the Mob War ends. (If a Mob War is already in effect, this
has the effect of doubling the hit rate.)
`

export const vendettaDescription = `
A Vendetta allows you to select 2 mobsters from each opponent and add them all to
the Hit List, in any order you choose. Then, a Mob War starts (or continues, if a Mob
War was already in effect), with 2 mobsters killed at the beginning of each player’s
turn. This continues until the Mob War ends. If you use a Safe House counter card
when Vendetta is played, your mobsters are not added to the Hit List, but the Mob
War still begins.
`

export const turnCoatDescription = `
The Turncoat lets you switch a mobster in play (on the Hit List or in front of a player)
with a mobster from the discard pile. The mobster being discarded must come from
the player with the most mobsters in play, and the returned mobster must be for the
active player with the least mobsters in play. In the case of a tie, you choose which of
the tied players are affected. The returned mobster comes back to the same spot on
the Hit List that the discarded mobster occupied, or is returned in front of the player if
the discarded mobster was not on the Hit List. This card does not bring an eliminated
player back into the game.
